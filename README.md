# DL-PROJECTS-B01-ID-TAMPERING-DETECTION

Ensuring the authenticity of ID cards is a significant challenge in modern identity verification systems. Fraudsters employ various sophisticated techniques to tamper with ID cards, posing serious security risks. Traditional detection methods often fall short in identifying these tampering techniques. Our project aims to address this issue by developing a deep learning-based system to detect multiple forms of ID card tampering, specifically focusing on photo substitution, text alteration, laminate peeling, and layered tampering.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- Develop a robust and accurate deep learning model capable of detecting specific types of ID card tampering.
- Create a user-friendly application that can process and analyze ID card images, providing clear tampering detection results.
- Enhance understanding and knowledge of identity verification and security techniques using deep learning.

## Tampering Methods Addressed

### Photo Substitution
- **Description**: Fraudsters replace the photograph on a genuine ID card with another to impersonate the original cardholder.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Intra-Class Diversity**: Variations in background, watermark, and ethnicities.
  - **Lighting Conditions**: Different lighting scenarios (day, night, interior, exterior).
  - **Image Quality**: Differences in camera quality, compression, and blur.

### Text Alteration
- **Description**: Alteration of textual information such as name, date of birth, or ID number to commit identity fraud.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Font Consistency**: Verifying font style, size, and spacing.
  - **Color Matching**: Matching the original text's color and texture.
  - **Alignment**: Ensuring proper alignment with the original layout.

### Laminate Peeling
- **Description**: Peeling off the protective laminate layer to make alterations and reapplying it.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Surface Integrity**: Detecting changes or damages to the laminate's surface.
  - **Edge Detection**: Identifying tampered edges where the laminate might not be perfectly reattached.

### Layered Tampering
- **Description**: Combining multiple tampering methods, such as photo substitution and text alteration, to evade detection.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Multi-Faceted Detection**: Implementing comprehensive methods to identify various tampering techniques.
  - **Increased Complexity**: Detecting sophisticated and layered tampering techniques.

## Approach

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Collection**: Gathering samples of genuine and tampered ID cards.
- **Preprocessing**: Using image processing techniques (e.g., resizing, normalization) to prepare the data for model training.

### Model Development
- **Model Selection**: Choosing a suitable deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Training**: Training the model on the collected dataset, using techniques like data augmentation to compensate for the limited data.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on validation and test sets, fine-tuning for improved accuracy.

### Flask Application Development
- **Setting Up Flask**: Creating a Flask application to serve the model.
- **Creating Routes**: Implementing routes for image upload and tampering detection.
- **Integrating Model**: Loading the trained model into the Flask app for inference.
- **User Interface**: Developing a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive tampering detection results.

### Deployment to Heroku
- **Preparing for Deployment**: Setting up necessary files (`Procfile`, `requirements.txt`) for Heroku deployment.
- **Deploying**: Deploying the Flask application to Heroku.
- **Testing**: Ensuring the deployed application functions correctly and efficiently.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Robust Detection System**: A deep learning model capable of accurately detecting photo substitution, text alteration, laminate peeling, and layered tampering.
- **User-Friendly Application**: A web-based application that provides easy and quick tampering detection results.
- **Enhanced Learning**: Improved understanding of deep learning applications in identity verification and security.

## Conclusion
By focusing on the specific tampering methods of photo substitution, text alteration, laminate peeling, and layered tampering, our project aims to develop a robust and effective solution for ID card tampering detection. Despite the limitations of a small dataset, we will leverage deep learning techniques and data augmentation to build a reliable system. This project not only addresses a critical security issue but also serves as a valuable learning experience in the application of deep learning for identity verification.
