# DL-PROJECTS-B01-ID-TAMPERING-DETECTION
Our learning project uses deep learning to detect ID card tampering, addressing issues like photo substitution, text alteration, and hologram manipulation. Despite a limited dataset, we aim to develop a robust system that accurately identifies tampered IDs, enhancing understanding of identity verification and security techniques.
